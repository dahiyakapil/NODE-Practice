If we need the form data or body so we have to use express.json middleware 

Steps to create the setup of nodejs application

Step 1 -->
    create a package.json file using npm init command
    Then create folders in src
    Then Connect the db using express
    Then error handling
    Then jwt in config folder
    Then create user schema in models folder
    After Creating the schema then create a auth contoller and pass the req, res
    And then go to services folder then write the logic in service 
    And then import every controller in routes folder
    And then hit the postman request POST: User Created

    Now passowrd is stored in string (Not good practice)
    Hash the password using bcrypt
    Go to model folder and hash the password

    Bcrypt Library:
    Salt : Generate a random string
    hash
    compare : It will compare the plaintext password 



    update user--> 
    user update himself -- authMiddleware
    only admin can update --> isAdmin middleware

    Create authMiddleware inside middlewares folder

    Case1 : User Update himself using AuthMiddleware
    Then we need token and we will get that from req.headers.authorization
    req.headers.authorization will return a string so we have to split it and it will be converted into array 
    In headers.authorization the token is stored like this : Bearer token
    so we need token so for this we will extract that index 1

    const token = req.header.authorization.split(" ")[1];

    jwt token methods--.
    1. verify : Matches the signature (We pass the proccess.env.JWT_SECRET) it matches this
    2. decode : It does not match the signature
